The sky turns pale with morning light,
As shadows flee the edge of night.
A breeze rolls soft across the land,
Like time itself with outstretched hand.

The dew clings tight to blades of grass,
Each drop a gem the sun will pass.
Birdsong lifts the sleeping trees,
And dances gently on the breeze.

The world, reborn with every day,
Wipes yesterday’s regrets away.
The brook hums low, a lullaby,
While clouds drift lazy in the sky.

No trumpets sound, no loud parade,
Just golden light and shifting shade.
A silent promise softly made—
That beauty blooms, though all things fade.

So walk with hope beneath the sun,
For every day is just begun.
