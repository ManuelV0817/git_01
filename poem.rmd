## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

How doth the little crocodile 
Improve his shining tail, 
And pour the waters of the Nile 
On every golden scale! 
How cheerfully he seems to grin,

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Before man came to blow it right
 The wind once blew itself untaught,
And did its loudest day and night
In any rough place where it caught.
 Man came to tell it what was wrong
 
 
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright —

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
The sky turns pale with morning light,
As shadows flee the edge of night.
A breeze rolls soft across the land,
Like time itself with outstretched hand.

The dew clings tight to blades of grass,
Each drop a gem the sun will pass.
Birdsong lifts the sleeping trees,
And dances gently on the breeze.

The world, reborn with every day,
Wipes yesterday’s regrets away.
The brook hums low, a lullaby,
While clouds drift lazy in the sky.

No trumpets sound, no loud parade,
Just golden light and shifting shade.
A silent promise softly made—
That beauty blooms, though all things fade.

So walk with hope beneath the sun,
For every day is just begun.
